caption: Timeout until idle profile is closed
default: 0
desc: |-
  Triggers an action when the computer is idle.

          If this policy is set to a positive number: it is a number of minutes. After that many minutes without user input, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> closes all browser windows, and shows the Profile Picker.

          If this policy is less than 5, or left unset: nothing happens when the computer is idle.

          "User input" is defined by Operating System APIs, and includes things like moving the mouse or typing on the keyboard.
