caption: Import saved passwords from default browser on first run
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled imports saved passwords from the previous default browser on first run. Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means no saved passwords are imported on first run.

        Users can trigger an import dialog and the saved passwords checkbox will be checked or unchecked to match this policy's value.
