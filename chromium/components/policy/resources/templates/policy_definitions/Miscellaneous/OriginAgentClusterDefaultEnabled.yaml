caption: Allows origin-keyed agent clustering by default.
default: true
desc: "This policy allows origin-keyed agent clustering by default.\n\n      The Origin-Agent-Cluster:\
  \ HTTP header controls whether a document is\n      isolated in an origin-keyed\
  \ agent cluster, or in a site-keyed agent\n      cluster. This has security implications\
  \ since an origin-keyed agent\n      cluster allows isolating documents by origin.\
  \ The developer-visible\n      consequence of this is that the document.domain accessor\
  \ can no longer\n      be set.\n\n      The default behaviour - when no Origin-Agent-Cluster:\
  \ header has been set\n      - changes in M106 from site-keyed to origin-keyed.\
  \ If this policy\n      is enabled or not set, the browser will follow this new\
  \ default from that\n      version on. If this policy is disabled this change is\
  \ reversed and\n      documents without Origin-Agent-Cluster: headers will be assigned\
  \ to\n      site-keyed agent clusters. As a consequence, the document.domain accessor\n\
  \      remains settable by default. This matches the legacy behaviour.\n\n     \
  \ See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/immutable-document-domain/\n      for additional\
  \ details.\n      "
