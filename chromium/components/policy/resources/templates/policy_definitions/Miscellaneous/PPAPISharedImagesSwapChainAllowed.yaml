caption: Allow modern buffer allocation for Graphics3D APIs PPAPI plugin.
desc: |-
  This policy controls the recent refactor for Graphics3D APIs in PPAPI plugin.

  The migration only affects internal implementation details and should not
  change any behavior. However, this policy can be used in case any PPAPI
  applications do not work as expected.

  When the policy is left unset or set to Enabled, the browser will decide which
  implementation is used.
  When the policy is set to Disabled, browser will use the old implementation
  until the policy is expired.
