  Switch the primary mouse button to the right button.

            If this policy is set to enabled, the right button of the mouse will always be the primary key.

            If this policy is set to disabled, the left button of the mouse will always be the primary key.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, the left button of the mouse will be the primary key initially, but can be switched by the user anytime.
