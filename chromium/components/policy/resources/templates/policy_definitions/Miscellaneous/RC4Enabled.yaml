caption: Enable RC4 cipher suites in TLS
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Warning: RC4 will be completely removed from <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> after version 52 (around September 2016) and this policy will stop working then.

        If the policy is not set, or is set to false, then RC4 cipher suites in TLS will not be enabled. Otherwise it may be set to true to retain compatibility with an outdated server. This is a stopgap measure and the server should be reconfigured.
