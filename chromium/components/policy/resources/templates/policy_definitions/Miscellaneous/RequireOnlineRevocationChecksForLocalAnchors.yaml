  Setting the policy to True means <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> always performs revocation checking for successfully validated server certificates signed by locally installed CA certificates. If <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> can't get revocation status information, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> treats these certificates as revoked (hard-fail).

        Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset means <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> uses existing online revocation-checking settings.
