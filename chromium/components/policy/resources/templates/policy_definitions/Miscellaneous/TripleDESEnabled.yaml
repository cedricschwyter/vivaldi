desc: "Warning: 3DES will be completely removed from <ph name=\"PRODUCT_NAME\">$1<ex>Google\
  \ Chrome</ex></ph> in version 95 (around October 2021) and this policy will stop\
  \ working then.\n\n      If the policy is set to true, then 3DES cipher suites in\
  \ TLS will be enabled. If it is set to false, they will be disabled. If the policy\
  \ is unset, 3DES cipher suites are disabled by default. This policy may be used\
  \ to temporarily retain compatibility with an outdated server. This is a stopgap\
  \ measure and the server should be reconfigured.\n      "
