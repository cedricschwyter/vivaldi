caption: Block access to a list of URLs
desc: |-
  Setting the policy prevents webpages with prohibited URLs from loading. It provides a list of URL patterns that specify forbidden URLs. Leaving the policy unset means no URLs are prohibited in the browser. Format the URL pattern according to this format ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format ). Up to 1,000 exceptions can be defined in <ph name="URL_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLAllowlist</ph>.

        From <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 73, you can block javascript://* URLs. However, it affects only JavaScript entered in the address bar (or, for example, bookmarklets). In-page JavaScript URLs with dynamically loaded data aren't subject to this policy. For example, if you block example.com/abc, then example.com can still load example.com/abc using XMLHTTPRequest.

        From <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 92, this policy is also supported in the headless mode.

        Note: Blocking internal chrome://* and chrome-untrusted://* URLs can lead to unexpected errors or may be circumvented in special cases. Instead of blocking certain internal URLs, see if there are more specific policies available. Common cases: Instead of blocking chrome://settings/certificates, use <ph name="CA_CERTIFICATE_MANAGEMENT_ALLOWED_POLICY_NAME">CACertificateManagementAllowed</ph>. Instead of blocking chrome-untrusted://crosh, use <ph name="SYSTEM_FEATURES_DISABLE_LIST_POLICY_NAME">SystemFeaturesDisableList</ph>.
