caption: Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means URL-keyed anonymized data collection, which sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to make searches and browsing better, is always active.

        Setting the policy to Disabled results in no URL-keyed anonymized data collection.

        If this policy is left unset, the user will be able to change this setting manually.
