caption: Automatic reboot on device shutdown
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> triggers a restart when users shut down the device. <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> replaces all shutdown buttons in the UI with restart buttons. If the users shut down devices using the power button, they won't automatically restart, even if the policy is on.

        Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> lets them shut down the device.
