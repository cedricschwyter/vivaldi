# List of CQ builders

[TOC]

Changes that only modify files in //infra/config, which do not change any build
outputs, only require the chromium_presubmit builder to pass before landing.

Each builder name links to that builder on Milo. The "matching builders" links
point to the file used to determine which configurations a builder should copy
when running. These links might 404 or error; they are hard-coded right now,
using common assumptions about how builders are configured.
"""

_REQUIRED_HEADER = """\
These builders must pass before a CL may land that affects files outside of
//docs and //infra/config.
"""

_OPTIONAL_HEADER = """\
These builders optionally run, depending on the files in a CL. For example, a CL
which touches `//gpu/BUILD.gn` would trigger the builder
`android_optional_gpu_tests_rel`, due to the `location_filters` values for that
builder.
"""

_EXPERIMENTAL_HEADER = """\
These builders are run on some percentage of builds. Their results are ignored
by CQ. These are often used to test new configurations before they are added
as required builders.
""" + ("""\

These builders are currently disabled due to the cq_disable_experiments outages
setting. See //infra/config/outages/README.md for more information.
