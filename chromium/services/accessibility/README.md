The accessibility service on Chrome OS provides accessibility services like
ChromeVox, Select-to-Speak, Switch Access and Dictation, and a framework API
to communicate with the operating system. On Chrome desktop, the
accessibility service can be used by native APIs to expose accessibility
information to the operating system.
