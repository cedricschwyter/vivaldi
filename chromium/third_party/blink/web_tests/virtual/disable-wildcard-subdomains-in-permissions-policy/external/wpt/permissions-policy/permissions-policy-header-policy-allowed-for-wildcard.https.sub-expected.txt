This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Permissions-Policy: fullscreen=("https://*.web-platform.test:8444") -- test allowlist is [self wildcard_origin]. assert_array_equals: expected property 0 to be "https://*.web-platform.test:8444" but got "https://%2A.web-platform.test:8444" (expected array ["https://*.web-platform.test:8444", "https://web-platform.test:8444"] got ["https://%2A.web-platform.test:8444", "https://web-platform.test:8444"])
PASS Permissions-Policy: fullscreen=("https://*.web-platform.test:8444") -- test fullscreen is allowed on same-origin subframe
PASS Permissions-Policy: fullscreen=("https://*.web-platform.test:8444") -- test fullscreen is allowed on same-origin subframe even with allow attribute
PASS Permissions-Policy: fullscreen=("https://*.web-platform.test:8444") -- test fullscreen is disallowed on cross-origin subframe
