This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL e.style['animation'] = "anim paused both reverse 4 1s -3s cubic-bezier(0, -2, 1, 3)" should set animation-delay-end assert_equals: animation-delay-end should be canonical expected (string) "0s" but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL e.style['animation'] = "anim paused both reverse 4 1s -3s cubic-bezier(0, -2, 1, 3)" should set animation-delay-start assert_equals: animation-delay-start should be canonical expected (string) "-3s" but got (undefined) undefined
PASS e.style['animation'] = "anim paused both reverse 4 1s -3s cubic-bezier(0, -2, 1, 3)" should set animation-direction

Harness: the test ran to completion.
